# BatteryTruth 🔋✨

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**BatteryTruth shows what your Mac battery is really reporting.**

macOS gives you a clean battery percentage. BatteryTruth digs one layer deeper and reads the raw numbers from the Mac battery controller: real charge, real full-charge capacity, real design capacity, real health, and live power flow. No guessing tables. No rounded dashboard magic. Just the numbers your Mac is exposing. ⚡️

## Why This Exists 🧠

Your menu bar might say `95%`, but the battery controller may be reporting more precise capacity data behind the scenes. BatteryTruth turns those raw values into a desktop dashboard so you can see:

- 🟢 true battery charge with two decimal places
- 💚 true battery health with two decimal places
- ⚡️ charging power and discharging power
- 🌡️ battery temperature and virtual temperature
- 🔁 cycle count and design cycle count
- 🔌 adapter details, voltage, and current
- 🧮 exactly which formula produced each result

## Features 🚀

- 🔋 **Real charge**: `AppleRawCurrentCapacity / AppleRawMaxCapacity`
- 💚 **Real health**: `AppleRawMaxCapacity / DesignCapacity`
- 🧩 **No hardcoded model table**: `DesignCapacity` is read from the current Mac
- ⚡️ **Live power flow**: charging watts and discharging watts from real voltage/current fields
- 🌡️ **Thermal readings**: battery temperature and virtual temperature when available
- 🖥️ **Mac-aware behavior**: MacBooks show internal battery data; desktop Macs show a clear no-battery state
- 🪟 **Native SwiftUI app**: glass-style dashboard, full-window layout, smooth scrolling, and menu bar display
- 🎛️ **Built-in settings**: menu bar style, charge-limit monitoring, thermal-limit monitoring, and local alert testing
- 🔔 **Real local alerts**: sends macOS notifications when real charge or temperature crosses your thresholds
- 🎨 **App icon included**: based on MIT-licensed Bootstrap Icons `battery-charging`

## Battery Math 🧮

BatteryTruth avoids rounded system UI values when raw battery fields are available.

True charge:

```text
AppleRawCurrentCapacity / AppleRawMaxCapacity * 100
```

True health:

```text
AppleRawMaxCapacity / DesignCapacity * 100
```

Power:

```text
Voltage(mV) * InstantAmperage(mA) / 1,000,000
```

Health is **not capped at 100%**. A new or recently calibrated battery can report a full-charge capacity above design capacity, and BatteryTruth shows that real value. ✅

## What It Does Not Do 🚧

BatteryTruth does **not** fake charging control. On macOS 14, there is no public API for this app to directly cut charging.

The charge-limit and thermal-protection settings are monitoring and warning features based on real battery data. They send local macOS notifications when thresholds are crossed, but they are useful signals, not hidden system-level charging switches. 🛡️

## Screenshot / UI Mood 🌌

BatteryTruth is designed as a dark glass desktop dashboard: large live numbers, a visual battery icon, health ring, raw capacity panel, power panel, and settings right inside the main UI.
