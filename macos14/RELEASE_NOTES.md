# BatteryTruth v1.0.2 for macOS 14

macOS 14 compatibility release.

## Highlights

- Reads real Mac battery charge from `AppleRawCurrentCapacity / AppleRawMaxCapacity`.
- Reads real battery health from `AppleRawMaxCapacity / DesignCapacity`.
- Displays charging and discharging power from battery-controller voltage and current.
- Shows battery temperature, virtual temperature, cycle count, adapter data, raw capacity data, and calculation source.
- Uses the current Mac battery controller's `DesignCapacity`; it does not use a fixed model-capacity table.
- Includes a full-window SwiftUI glass dashboard, menu bar display, and in-app settings.
- Includes a macOS `.app` bundle in the release asset.
- Sends local macOS notifications when real charge or battery temperature crosses the configured thresholds.
- Shows live protection and notification status inside the settings panel.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or newer
- Apple laptop with an internal battery for full raw readings

## Notes

BatteryTruth does not directly control charging. Charge-limit and thermal-protection settings are monitoring features based on real battery data.

The app bundle is unsigned and not notarized. If macOS Gatekeeper blocks launch, build locally from source with:

```bash
./script/build_and_run.sh --verify
```
