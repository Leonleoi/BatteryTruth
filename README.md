# BatteryTruth

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

BatteryTruth is a native macOS SwiftUI app for reading real battery capacity, real battery health, and live power data from the Mac battery controller.

It is built for macOS 15+ and packaged with Swift Package Manager.

## Features

- Real battery charge percentage with two decimal places
- Real battery health percentage with two decimal places
- No hardcoded design-capacity table: `DesignCapacity` is read from the current Mac
- Live charging power and discharging power
- Voltage, current, battery temperature, virtual temperature, cycle count, design cycle count, and adapter data
- AppleSmartBattery raw data first, IOPowerSources fallback when raw fields are unavailable
- Works across Mac models that expose an internal battery; desktop Macs show an explicit no-battery state
- SwiftUI desktop dashboard with dark glass styling, full-window layout, smooth scrolling, and menu bar display
- Built-in settings panel for menu bar style, charge-limit monitoring, and thermal-limit monitoring
- MIT-licensed app icon source based on Bootstrap Icons `battery-charging`

## Battery Math

BatteryTruth avoids rounded system UI values when raw battery fields are available.

True charge:

```text
AppleRawCurrentCapacity / AppleRawMaxCapacity * 100
```

True health:

```text
AppleRawMaxCapacity / DesignCapacity * 100
```

Power:

```text
Voltage(mV) * InstantAmperage(mA) / 1,000,000
```

Health is not capped at 100%. New or recently calibrated batteries can report a full-charge capacity above design capacity.

## Limits

BatteryTruth does not fake charging control. On macOS 15 there is no public API for this app to directly cut charging. Charge-limit and thermal-protection settings in the app are monitoring and warning features based on real battery data.

## Disclaimer

Use BatteryTruth at your own risk. This app reads and displays battery information from macOS and IOKit, but it is provided as-is without warranty.
